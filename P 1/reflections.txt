You've learned a lot about web development so far. 
I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here.
 
Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?

- I have learned how to use tags properly and not mix CSS with HTML  

* What has been easy?
  
- After working for the past 4 days in my portfolio page, working on this article
seemed quite easy. I've noticed that I am much more confident on how I build the code.
 

* What has been difficult?
 
Not missing little, small details. 

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to 
overcome challenges so far?


Well started laying out the sample code, then opened in my browser, noticed a couple
of bugs that were not working, so back to adjusting, testing, adjusting, testing until
I got the layout that I wanted.
